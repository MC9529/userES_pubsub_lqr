# Configuration of the empirical weights (Q_empirical, R_empirical):
Q_empirical: [1.0,6.0,1.0,1.0] # Do not remove the brackets
R_empirical: [0.25] # Do not remove the brackets

# Configuration of the design weights (Q_design, R_design):
# Parametrization of parameter i, as Q(i,i) = a * theta + b
# [i,a,b]:
#   i: index of the parametrized element of the diagonal (index starts at one, not at zero)
#   a: slope
#   b: offset
Q_design: 
  - [2, 1, 0]
R_design:
  - [0, 0, 0]

# Parameters:
pars: [6]
# pars: [6] # This works for the demos, as safe controller

# Parametrization structure:
use_linear_scaling: true # false for exponential scaling
